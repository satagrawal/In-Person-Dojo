Pre-Planning Phase

Define the product team's goals and objectives for the dojo coaching session.
Identify the specific skills or areas of focus for the product teams.
Determine the duration and frequency of the coaching sessions.
If you would like to partner with another coach, then include him/her in all your conversations/meetings with the product team
If the majority of the team members are local to RW then please emphasize for in-person because of the immersive engagement
If the product team is participating in person, the product team should be arranging travel after getting appropriate permissions from their management..same applies for DOJO coaches as well
Understand the timeline to conduct dojo sessions.  How much advanced notice does the team needs, if they have to travel.
