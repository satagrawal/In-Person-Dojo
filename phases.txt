Pre-Planning Phase

Define the product team's goals and objectives for the dojo coaching session.
Identify the specific skills or areas of focus for the product teams.
Determine the duration and frequency of the coaching sessions.
If you would like to partner with another coach, then include him/her in all your conversations/meetings with the product team
If the majority of the team members are local to RW then please emphasize for in-person because of the immersive engagement
If the product team is participating in person, the product team should be arranging travel after getting appropriate permissions from their management..same applies for DOJO coaches as well
Understand the timeline to conduct dojo sessions.  How much advanced notice does the team needs, if they have to travel.

Logistics

Arrange a suitable venue with enough space for all participants and equipment.
Ensure the venue has good internet connectivity and access to necessary tools.
Set up comfortable seating arrangements and workstations for each team.
Provide necessary amenities like whiteboards, flip charts, markers, and stationery.
Arrange for projectors or large screens for presentations and demonstrations.
Ensure the availability of power outlets and extension cords for charging devices.
Arrange for refreshments and snacks to keep participants energized (optional)
Assess the availability of suitable space for conducting the dojo sessions.

Find a suitable place with enough room for everyone and the necessary equipment:
This means choosing a location that can fit all the participants and the tools they need for the Dojo. It should have enough space for people to move around comfortably and work together.

Make sure the place has good internet and all the tools they need:
Ensure the location has a reliable internet connection so that participants can access online resources and collaborate effectively. Also, make sure they have access to the software and tools required for the training.

Set up comfortable seating and workspaces for each team:
Provide chairs and desks that are comfortable to sit in for long periods. Each team should have their own designated workspace.

Get things like whiteboards, markers, and paper for brainstorming:
Have tools like whiteboards and flip charts available for participants to visualize and discuss ideas. Provide markers and paper for note-taking and sketching.

Organize projectors or big screens for showing presentations:
Use projectors or large screens to display presentations, code examples, and demonstrations so that everyone can see clearly.

Ensure there are enough power outlets and extension cords for charging devices:
Make sure there are plenty of places to plug in laptops and other electronic devices. Provide extension cords if needed.

Offer refreshments and snacks to keep everyone energized (optional):
Providing drinks and snacks during breaks can help keep participants energized and focused.

Check if the place is suitable for conducting the Dojo sessions:
Before finalizing the location, consider factors like the room's size, noise level, and lighting to ensure it's conducive to interactive learning and group activities.

By taking care of these logistics, you can create a comfortable and productive environment for the in-person software engineering Dojo, making it easier for participants to learn and collaborate effectively.
