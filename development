I started the year 2023 by kicking off to speak on the benefits of test automation which includes TDD, BDD, Contract Testing, Mutation testing etc. I continuously emphasized to each and every product team engineer who were in the Dojo training with me to ask questions, be curious, learn test automation by upskilling yourself and building top-class products for our customers. I have always encouraged everybody around me to continuously keep learning.



I was given the best opportunity to show my eminence this year to speak Harnessing Kubernetes to Manage microservices at scale at OSS. Since I am very passionate about containers and the ecosystem around it, I presented by telling a story around the topic. I am also doing a lightning talk on Empowering Microservices using a service mesh at Kubecon 2023.  I submitted CPFs to speak at DevOps Days Chicago, OSFF, KubeCon and Cloud Native 2023.



Partnered with APMs across various product families to help facilitate craftworx assessments for their product teams showing the tremendous value in doing them. A lot of follow-ups with various product teams was done to showcase their own product team site on the dta site.



Being a team member of the winning team at the Ansible Hackathon made me realized that with awesome teamwork, it's not difficult to come with a use case in less than 36 hours to show how Ansible can be well utilized to automate renewal certifications which results in major savings as this is a manual process currently



Throughout this year I mentored, volunteered, persuaded leadership to do in-person dojos, lead to expicitly demonstrate my leadership skills within and outside our DTA Dojo communities.   I am always available to build the best team by actively interviewing the best candidates and continuously help them train and get up to speed.
