I started the year 2023 by kicking off to speak on the benefits of test automation which includes TDD, BDD, Contract Testing, Mutation testing etc. I continuously emphasized to each and every product team engineer who were in the Dojo training with me to ask questions, be curious, learn test automation by upskilling yourself and building top-class products for our customers. I have always encouraged everybody around me to continuously keep learning.



I was given the best opportunity to show my eminence this year to speak Harnessing Kubernetes to Manage microservices at scale at OSS. Since I am very passionate about containers and the ecosystem around it, I presented by telling a story around the topic. I am also doing a lightning talk on Empowering Microservices using a service mesh at Kubecon 2023.  I submitted CPFs to speak at DevOps Days Chicago, OSFF, KubeCon and Cloud Native 2023.



Partnered with APMs across various product families to help facilitate craftworx assessments for their product teams showing the tremendous value in doing them. A lot of follow-ups with various product teams was done to showcase their own product team site on the dta site.



Being a team member of the winning team at the Ansible Hackathon made me realized that with awesome teamwork, it's not difficult to come with a use case in less than 36 hours to show how Ansible can be well utilized to automate renewal certifications which results in major savings as this is a manual process currently



Throughout this year I mentored, volunteered, persuaded leadership to do in-person dojos, lead to expicitly demonstrate my leadership skills within and outside our DTA Dojo communities.   I am always available to build the best team by actively interviewing the best candidates and continuously help them train and get up to speed.


In 2023, I kicked off the year by passionately advocating the benefits of test automation, including TDD, BDD, Contract Testing, and Mutation Testing. I consistently encouraged all the product team engineers training in the Dojo with me to be inquisitive, upskill in test automation, and strive to create top-class products for our customers. My motto has always been to inspire continuous learning.

This year, I seized the opportunity to showcase my expertise by delivering a talk on "Harnessing Kubernetes to Manage Microservices at Scale" at OSS. As a container enthusiast, I shared my insights through storytelling. Additionally, I presented a lightning talk on "Empowering Microservices Using a Service Mesh" at Kubecon 2023. I also submitted speaking proposals to prominent events like DevOps Days Chicago, OSFF, KubeCon, and Cloud Native 2023.

I collaborated with APMs from various product families to facilitate craftworx assessments for their product teams, demonstrating the significant value of these assessments. I diligently followed up with numerous product teams to ensure their product team sites were featured on the DTA site.

Being a part of the winning team at the Ansible Hackathon emphasized the power of teamwork. We efficiently devised a use case in less than 36 hours, highlighting how Ansible can automate certification renewals, resulting in substantial cost savings compared to the current manual process.

Throughout the year, I served as a mentor, volunteered, and persuaded leadership to conduct in-person dojos, demonstrating my leadership skills within and outside the DTA Dojo communities. I remained dedicated to building exceptional teams by actively participating in candidate interviews and providing continuous support to help them upskill and excel.
